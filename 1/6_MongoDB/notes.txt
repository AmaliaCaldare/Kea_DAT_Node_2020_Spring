Relational Databases vs. NoSQL

MySQL               MongoDB(document database)
MariaDB             DynamoDB
Oracle              Firebase
PostgreSQL          Realm(object database)
CouchDB             Neo43

tables              collections (like table, arrays that are contained in the databases)      

collections: furniture
{}

    {
        "key": "value"
    },

    {
        "price": 20.00
    },

    {

    }
}

Use Cases of MongoDB: 

Do use:

- not sure about schema yet
    - leads to rapid prototyping
        - type of companies: start-ups

Don't use:

- data that is consistent or relational

- data that is crucial

- if you have a set schema


More info:
     - in MongoDb you handle relations, data validation etc. in the application layer
     - for relational database you can also do it in the application layer
                      but the database is another safety net

Performance: benchmark MongoDb
